weight: 1
---

- **What it does**: Implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Jenkins, enabling external clients—particularly LLM-based tools—to interact programmatically with Jenkins jobs, builds, and context. Includes built-in tools such as `whoAmI`, job status, and build logs.
- **Why it matters**: Bridges the gap between AI agents and Jenkins, allowing for deeper integration, automation, and AI-assisted DevOps workflows.
- **Tech Stack / Highlights**: Built as a Jenkins plugin using Java; supports extensible MCP interface.
- **GitHub Repository**: [jenkins-mcp-server](https://github.com/avisangle/jenkins-mcp-server)
